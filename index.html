      <p id="description">Ponyboi is an intersex runaway. 
        He works at a laundromat and hustles as sex-worker. 
        But after a mysterious encounter with a man from his dreams, 
        he learns that perhaps he is worthy of leaving his seedy life in 
        New Jersey behind. Ponyboi is a queer film about discovering 
        self-redemption and love. Directed by River Gallo and 
        Sad√© Clacken Joseph, and produced by Stephen Fry and Emma Thompson, 
        the film is a proof of concept for a feature length version.
